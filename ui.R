  more specific genre. \"Literature\" refers to the books that were labeled as 
  fiction but had no other listed genre. Note: When displaying 3 genres, Historical 
  Fiction and Mystery are overtaken by Juvenile Fiction from April and July. These

    in format is also pretty distinct; eBooks jump in share slightly and audio 
    checkouts shrink slightly, but physical books and videos are decimated until 
    August, when curbside pickup was opened early in the month. Overall patronage 
    never recovered from its early highs in 2020, but the continued use of eBooks 
    and digital audio book services showed that Seattlites were still wanting to 
    engage with the materials they had during quarantine. Further exploration is 
    needed to explain why the video category consistently ranked so low; is it 
    simply because SPL only did physical checkouts of videos, or are their streaming
