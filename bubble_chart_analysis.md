This chart visualizes the city's interests by month in 2020. We chose to
generate this chart because it displays the five books that Seattle residents
checked out most each month from the Seattle Public Libraries in 2020. These
books represent Seattlites' interests throughout the months of 2020. We chose
to exclude all titles classified as classic literature because those titles
skewed our results away from Seattlites' current interests. People often choose
to check out classic literature from public libraries because public libraries'
collections skew towards older publications and it is more convenient to borrow
these books (that will only be read once) rather than purchase them. Such titles
include _Jane Eyre_, _Treasure Island_, _Pride and Prejudice_, and _Frankenstein_.

Of all non-classical literature titles in 2020, the text that Seattlites were
most interested in reading for the year was Michelle Obama's memoir,
_Becoming_, followed by Ijeoma Oluo's _So You Want to Talk About Race_ and
Tara Westover's memoir _Educated_. Coinciding with protests in 2020 following
the death of George Floyd at the hands of police, 40% of the top ten list for
the year spoke directly on race in America; notably, aside from Obama and
Oluo's aforementioned texts, Ibram X. Kendi and Robin Wall Kimmerer are the only
other authors of color on this list with _How to Be an Antiracist_ and
_Braiding Sweetgrass_. In monthly terms, the highest number of monthly checkouts
was 5,218 checkouts of _So You Want to Talk about Race_, followed by
3,211 checkouts of _White Fragility_, and 2,811 checkouts of
_Me and White Supremacy_, all in June, the month after George Floyd's death.

Checkout trends generally follow what's nationally interesting; at the end of
2020, _Becoming_ sat on the New York Times bestseller list for 88 weeks, as did
Glennon Doyle's _Untamed_ with 39 weeks and _Braiding Sweetgrass_ with 34.
