We chose this chart to analyze the public's interest in specific genres over the
course of the year, as a worldwide pandemic may affect the topics people are interested
in checking out. As we can see, the most popular genres stay fairly regular relative to one another, with
the exception of Juvenile Fiction (YA novel), which began being checked out at
an incredible rate as quarantine set in. A likely explanation for this finding
is that when school was canceled for middle and high schoolers, many of them
choose to check out their favorite books to read while stuck at home. Young
Adult is a very popular genre with this age group and this would explain the 
sudden boom in checkouts.

Many of the books' primary genres were labeled as fiction/nonfiction, which
would've been the most popular "genres" by far had they been included on the
graph. Because splitting up books into these two labels is vague and inconsistent
(not every book had this distinction, and some had them elsewhere in their list
of subjects), we chose to replace these labels with their secondary, more specific
genre. "Literature" refers to the books that were labeled as fiction but had no
other listed genre.
